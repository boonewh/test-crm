My Top 5 Recommendations for Next Implementation:

Sales Pipeline Overview - Immediate business value
Quick Actions Bar - Daily workflow improvement
Stale Records Alert - Prevents lost opportunities
Activity Streak - Motivational and habit-forming
Project Value Summary - Executive visibility

What resonates most with your users' daily workflow? Are they more data-driven or action-oriented?RetryWBSo stale records alerts sounds great, as long as they are dismissible. would that take a database update?EditGreat question! For dismissible stale record alerts, you'd definitely want a database update to track which alerts users have dismissed. Here's what I'd recommend:
üóÑÔ∏è Database Approach (Recommended)
New Table: user_alert_dismissals
sqlCREATE TABLE user_alert_dismissals (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    alert_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,  -- 'stale_client', 'stale_lead', 'stale_project'
    entity_type VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL, -- 'client', 'lead', 'project' 
    entity_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    dismissed_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    dismissed_until TIMESTAMP NULL,    -- Optional: dismiss until specific date
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id),
    UNIQUE(user_id, alert_type, entity_type, entity_id)
);
Alternative: Add to existing ActivityLog
sql-- Add new ActivityType enum values
ActivityType.dismissed_alert = "dismissed_alert"

-- Use existing table with specific description format
INSERT INTO activity_logs (user_id, action, entity_type, entity_id, description)
VALUES (1, 'dismissed_alert', 'client', 123, 'stale_record_alert');
üéØ Alert Logic Examples
Backend Alert Generation
pythondef get_stale_alerts(user_id, tenant_id):
    # Get stale records (no activity in 30+ days)
    stale_clients = get_stale_clients(user_id, tenant_id, days=30)
    stale_leads = get_stale_leads(user_id, tenant_id, days=21) 
    stale_projects = get_stale_projects(user_id, tenant_id, days=14)
    
    # Filter out dismissed alerts
    active_alerts = filter_dismissed_alerts(user_id, stale_records)
    
    return active_alerts
Frontend Dashboard Component
typescriptconst [dismissedAlerts, setDismissedAlerts] = useState<Set<string>>();

const dismissAlert = async (entityType: string, entityId: number) => {
  await apiFetch('/alerts/dismiss', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({
      alert_type: 'stale_record',
      entity_type: entityType,
      entity_id: entityId,
      dismiss_for_days: 7 // Don't show again for a week
    })
  });
  
  // Update local state
  setDismissedAlerts(prev => new Set([...prev, `${entityType}-${entityId}`]));
};
üîß Implementation Options
Option 1: Simple Dismissals (Permanent)

Dismiss = never show again for this record
Lightweight, easy to implement
Good for "I know this is stale but it's intentional"

Option 2: Time-based Dismissals (Recommended)

Dismiss for X days (7/14/30 days)
Alert reappears if still stale after dismissal period
Better for "remind me later" workflow

Option 3: Smart Re-alerting

Track last activity date when dismissed
Only re-alert if new activity happened then went stale again
Most sophisticated but complex

üé® UI/UX Considerations
Dashboard Alert Panel
typescript<div className="bg-orange-50 border-l-4 border-orange-500 p-4 rounded">
  <div className="flex justify-between items-start">
    <div>
      <h3 className="font-semibold text-orange-800">Stale Records Alert</h3>
      <p>These records haven't been updated in 30+ days:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-4">
        <li>Acme Corp (Client) - 45 days</li>
        <li>BigOil Project (Project) - 32 days</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div className="flex gap-2">
      <button onClick={() => dismissAlert('all', 7)}>
        Dismiss for 1 week
      </button>
      <button onClick={() => dismissAlert('all', 0)}>
        √ó
      </button>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
üìä Business Logic
Stale Thresholds (Configurable)

Leads: 21 days (hot leads cool off quickly)
Clients: 30 days (established relationships)
Projects: 14 days (active projects need frequent updates)
Won Projects: 60 days (maintenance/follow-up)

Smart Filtering

Don't alert on "lost" or "completed" status
Don't alert on records created in last X days
Different thresholds for different industries/types

üöÄ Migration Strategy

Phase 1: Add dismissal table, basic dismiss forever
Phase 2: Add time-based dismissals
Phase 3: Add smart re-alerting and user preferences

Minimal Viable Implementation:

New user_alert_dismissals table
Simple "dismiss forever" for stale records
Dashboard widget with dismissible alerts
Backend endpoint to track dismissals
